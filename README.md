# SQR language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting to SQR files in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate/) from this [SQR TextMate bundle](http://advws.blogspot.com/2009/03/creating-textmate-bundle.html).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
